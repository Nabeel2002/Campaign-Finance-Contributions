Data Model (Snowflake Schema)
This data warehouse will follow a Snowflake schema due to its flexibility in handling hierarchical relationships between dimension tables.

Fact Table: Contributions

Primary Key: Transaction (Unique ID for each contribution)
Foreign Keys:
Recipient (references Dimension table: Recipients)
Contribution_Date (references Dimension table: Dates)

Dimension Tables:
Donors:
Donor (Primary Key) - Name of the donor
Donor_Type (Individual/Entity)
Donor_Address
City_State_Zip
Donor_Reported_Occupation
Donor_Reported_Employer

Recipients:
Recipient (Primary Key) - Name of the recipient (candidate, officeholder, or committee)
Dates:
Contribution_Date (Primary Key) - Date of contribution
Contribution_Year (Year of contribution)
Additional Dimension Tables (Optional):

Report_Types: (if needed for detailed report analysis)
Report_Filed (Primary Key) - Type of report (e.g., C-4 Report, Year-End Report)

Contribution_Types: (if further breakdown of contribution types is desired)
Contribution_Type (Primary Key) - Monetary, In-Kind, Pledged

Populate the Data Warehouse (This step would involve loading data from the City of Austin Data Portal)

I can use various methods to populate the data warehouse, such as:

ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools
Custom scripts to read and transform data
Database import utilities
Making the Data Warehouse Accessible

I can Set up user accounts and permissions: Grant read-only access to analysts using tools like pgAdmin for PostgreSQL.
BI tools integration: Configure your BI tool (e.g., Tableau, Power BI) to connect directly to the data warehouse.
API development: Develop a secure API to allow programmatic access to the data.
